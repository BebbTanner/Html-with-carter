            Horizontal rule element?
            Table on page 36 of the web basics book.

    Eventually, somewhere in here I need to go over div elements and how to link the CSS page,.
    I always forget how to link the CSS file. I almost always end up looking it up.
    At some point I think it would be benficial to go over how to work with frameworks.
    And I need to include a section on how to add image files in the project as well.
