NOTES

    I am going to start by reworking the nav bar. I know that Carter has and idea 
for what he wants to do with the navbar. I am just going to start by fine tuning it and 
being absolutely sure that it functions as intended. Carter will prolly keep working on
his site as he chooses by playing around with the features that he wants.

    I think that it might be beneficial to run a web framework now rather than later.
Bootstrap has a prebuilt navigation bar built into it.

                The nav class is use to get the general styling of the navbar.
            Giving it the inverse tag makes the navbar a dark gray color. I am 
            going to look further into the documentation.

                Currently, I am trying to figure out how to take the non active items in the 
            navbar and align them to the right of the nav bar. This is the layout that carter
            wanted so I am attempting to do so. I believe that If I add the active class in 
            the css file I should be able to make just those items align to the right of the 
            navbar.
